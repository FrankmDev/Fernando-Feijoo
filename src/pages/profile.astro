          Feijoo holds an MA in Fine Art Printmaking from Winchester Art School
          and a BA in Illustration from Maidstone, Kent. He solidified his
          technical expertise training as a master printer at the renowned
          Curwen Studio before transitioning into the field of Art education. <br

          As a multi-disciplinary artist, Feijoo’s practice fluidly explores a
          wide range of media, creating a dialogue between printmaking, drawing,
          painting, artist books, and ceramics. He has exhibited his work
          internationally, winning many prestigious prizes and awards, with his
          pieces acquired by numerous permanent collections. Currently, he is

      Collaborating with Fernando Feijoo is always the most stimulating
      challenge! From initial bouncing of ideas based on an immense variety of
      inspirations -from contemporary events, world calamities, political
      shenanigans and corruptions, to literary or artistic influences, and
      animated discussions. Often it is just word play and sometimes
      misunderstandings which are thought provoking and/or hilarious. Research
      follows. Drafts are tentatively produced. Fragments are extracted,
      sketches made. Talking and writing and drawing all at the same time. A
      structure emerges. Then there can be a long process of determining the
      layout and composition, the detailed honing of particular skills in lino,
      or etching or whatever is right for this subject, and the layers and
      layers of printmaking undertaken in the small hours. Sometimes it is hours
      of reading through existing texts and trying to find our angle. Sometimes
      it is an existing structure such as an alphabet that is created on a
      theme. Often it is the joint creation of a new or different style of word
      making and print making. The writer has to go for frequent walks to let
      the words move around in the brain and be said aloud. The artist observes
      and sketches, and draws the line in the lino or the plate. Two processes
      merge into the final work. In most of our collaborations my work as a
      writer is in the early stages and then it is all handed over to the
      artist. Only a little tweaking is needed later. We both delight in the
      sudden fizzes of getting something right and share the greatest respect
      and appreciation of each other’s skills.

      My work has a sense of humor within it even though sometimes I make images
      which reflect the darker side of human nature. I am interested in
      <em>social and political issues</em> and reflect these themes within my work.
      My narrative images have hidden layers of information within them which the
      viewer can find each time they return to the work. The closer you are drawn
      into the image, the more you understand about the characters and the lives
      they lead. The process of drawing is fundamental for me. I enjoy how it translates
      through different print processes and creates alternate styles of work. I see
      myself as a journeyman: travelling around, absorbing all the variety of cultural
      differences and architectural styles when I visit a new city, exploring people's
      lives and conditions in the twenty first century. These observations are then
      reflected throughout my work as a series of sequential narrative images. I
      enjoy exploring new ways of making work through combining different media together,
      working with the interactions and juxtapositions of materials and techniques,
      which encourage fresh viewpoints and outcomes. Drawing is a powerful medium
      which allows me to push my ideas into different directions and create the fantastic.
      There are no rules to be followed: just pure experimentation and fun to be
      had.

    <p class="text-base md:text-xl mt-4 mx-auto leading-relaxed">
      Review of the work of Fernando Feijoo We are now approaching the 3rd
      decade of the 21st century, living in what not so many years ago was
      called ‘the future’. There are, to be certain, some things about our world
      that resemble the visions of Science Fiction writers, but much of daily
      life is still about people doing what they can to make a living in an
      increasingly divided world. It is that world that is the source of the
      inspiration and subject matter for the challenging, entertaining, visceral
      and unique work of Fernando Feijoo. To begin with, his art is extremely
      well made, technically flawless but, unlike some artists in the
      international printmaking community for whom technical perfection seems to
      be the primary goal, it goes much further than that. The high degree of
      skill that he has in his hands is inseparable from the originality and
      acuteness of his observation of the urban world around him, as well as his
      desire to ensure that his work should relate strongly to the times in
      which we live. In his work he holds up a mirror to the world around him
      and shows us its reflection. As with all reflections there are sometimes
      distortions and exaggerations, but these only serve to heighten the drama
      of his subject matter. The world that is reflected is seldom a pretty
      place: it is by turns perplexing, hard, comical, tragic, and melancholic,
      but his work is always respectful of the people and situations it depicts.
      Further than that it can be brutally honest in its portrayal of parts of
      our world that are far from being perfect, and from which many people turn
      away. There are echoes in his work, as the artist gladly acknowledges, of
      artists such as Hogarth and Goya, and also Daumier, Masereel and Posada
      among others, all of whom used the techniques of printmaking and its
      inherent reproducibility to comment on their world. While their work did
      not by itself succeed in changing the course of history, such artists did
      have a powerful effect on the thinking of some of those who saw their work
      and that in its turn led towards some improvement in the societies in
      which they lived. In this sense Fernando Feijoo’s work and approach makes
      him heir to a long and honourable tradition of socially engaged artists.
      Just as his antecedents made use of the opportunities and materials
      available to them, so also does Feijoo. The difference is that the
      media-rich world in which we live affords him a far greater range of
      mediums, materials and means for sharing than were ever available in the
      past. This artist works across many artistic mediums, from drawing through
      painting and sculpture to books and illustration, selecting not only the
      appropriate medium (or mediums) for the expression of his ideas, but also
      the materials with which to render them to the best advantage and in his
      distinctive style. One of the strong points in this artist’s work is that
      much of it is based on the ideas, sketches and references that he records
      in his notebooks, one or more of which travels everywhere with him. Many
      artists these days use a smartphone or perhaps a digital camera to make a
      record of some of the things that have caught their eye and which could be
      incorporated in a future work. Feijoo prefers to use a sketchbook, a
      time-honoured process-rich means of making connections. To have the
      privilege of seeing an artist’s sketchbooks within the context of an
      exhibition adds considerably to the enjoyment of the work – it makes the
      connections visible. Drawing has become under-rated in our tech-rich
      lives, but is still a potent medium. This is evident in his sketchbooks,
      but also in to richness of line in his prints, and in his other works.
      They are compositionally complex, creating visions of an ‘other’ world
      through which the viewer’s eyes can wander, seeking out the secrets or
      guessing at what is going on. To pay due respect to Feijoo’s work requires
      a sense of engagement and complicity from the viewer, and the time spent
      is well-rewarded. Many of his works are in stark black and white,
      sometimes combining with great skill within the same image, areas that
      appear to be in negative and others in positive, adding a richness to the
      whole piece. His use of colour, when it happens, is closer to comic book
      than limpid watercolour, and all the more appropriate for that. In all of
      his works there are layers of visual mastery, trickery even, that make the
      act of looking at them both an adventure and an excitement, with an
      aftermath of thought-provoking satisfaction.
