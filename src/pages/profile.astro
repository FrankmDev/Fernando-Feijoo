              My work has a sense of humor within it even though sometimes I
              make images which reflect the darker side of human nature. I am
              interested in social and political issues and reflect these themes
              within my work. My narrative images have hidden layers of
              information within them which the viewer can find each time they
              return to the work. The closer you are drawn into the image, the
              more you understand about the characters and the lives they lead.
              The process of drawing is fundamental for me. I enjoy how it
              translates through different print processes and creates alternate
              styles of work.
            </p>
            <p>
              I see myself as a journeyman: travelling around, absorbing all the
              variety of cultural differences and architectural styles when I
              visit a new city, exploring people's lives and conditions in the
              twenty first century. These observations are then reflected
              throughout my work as a series of sequential narrative images.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoy exploring new ways of making work through combining
              different media together, working with the interactions and
              juxtapositions of materials and techniques, which encourage fresh
              viewpoints and outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Drawing is a powerful medium which allows me to push my ideas into
              different directions and create the fantastic. There are no rules
              to be followed: just pure experimentation and fun to be had.

              Collaborating with Fernando Feijoo is always the most stimulating
              challenge!

              From initial bouncing of ideas based on an immense variety of
              inspirations - from contemporary events, world calamities,
              political shenanigans and corruptions, to literary or artistic
              influences, and animated discussions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Often it is just word play and sometimes misunderstandings which
              are thought provoking and/or hilarious. Research follows. Drafts
              are tentatively produced. Fragments are extracted, sketches made.
              Talking and writing and drawing all at the same time. A structure
              emerges. Then there can be a long process of determining the
              layout and composition, the detailed honing of particular skills
              in lino, or etching or whatever is right for this subject, and the
              layers and layers of printmaking undertaken in the small hours.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sometimes it is hours of reading through existing texts and trying
              to find our angle. Sometimes it is an existing structure such as
              an alphabet that is created on a theme. Often it is the joint
              creation of a new or different style of word making and print
              making.
            </p>
            <p>
              The writer has to go for frequent walks to let the words move
              around in the brain and be said aloud. The artist observes and
              sketches, and draws the line in the lino or the plate. Two
              processes merge into the final work. In most of our collaborations
              my work as a writer is in the early stages and then it is all
              handed over to the artist. Only a little tweaking is needed later.
            </p>
            <p>
              We both delight in the sudden fizzes of getting something right
              and share the greatest respect and appreciation of each other's
              skills.

          <h2 class="section-title">Review of the work of Fernando Feijoo</h2>
          <blockquote class="statement">
            <p>
              We are now approaching the 3rd decade of the 21st century, living
              in what not so many years ago was called 'the future'. There are,
              to be certain, some things about our world that resemble the
              visions of Science Fiction writers, but much of daily life is
              still about people doing what they can to make a living in an
              increasingly divided world. It is that world that is the source of
              the inspiration and subject matter for the challenging,
              entertaining, visceral and unique work of Fernando Feijoo. To
              begin with, his art is extremely well made, technically flawless
              but, unlike some artists in the international printmaking
              community for whom technical perfection seems to be the primary
              goal, it goes much further than that. The high degree of skill
              that he has in his hands is inseparable from the originality and
              acuteness of his observation of the urban world around him, as
              well as his desire to ensure that his work should relate strongly
              to the times in which we live. In his work he holds up a mirror to
              the world around him and shows us its reflection. As with all
              reflections there are sometimes distortions and exaggerations, but
              these only serve to heighten the drama of his subject matter. The
              world that is reflected is seldom a pretty place: it is by turns
              perplexing, hard, comical, tragic, and melancholic, but his work
              is always respectful of the people and situations it depicts.
              Further than that it can be brutally honest in its portrayal of
              parts of our world that are far from being perfect, and from which
              many people turn away.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are echoes in his work, as the artist gladly acknowledges,
              of artists such as Hogarth and Goya, and also Daumier, Masereel
              and Posada among others, all of whom used the techniques of
              printmaking and its inherent reproducibility to comment on their
              world. While their work did not by itself succeed in changing the
              course of history, such artists did have a powerful effect on the
              thinking of some of those who saw their work and that in its turn
              led towards some improvement in the societies in which they lived.
              In this sense Fernando Feijoo's work and approach makes him heir
              to a long and honourable tradition of socially engaged artists.
              Just as his antecedents made use of the opportunities and
              materials available to them, so also does Feijoo. The difference
              is that the media-rich world in which we live affords him a far
              greater range of mediums, materials and means for sharing than
              were ever available in the past. This artist works across many
              artistic mediums, from drawing through painting and sculpture to
              books and illustration, selecting not only the appropriate medium
              (or mediums) for the expression of his ideas, but also the
              materials with which to render them to the best advantage and in
              his distinctive style.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the strong points in this artist's work is that much of it
              is based on the ideas, sketches and references that he records in
              his notebooks, one or more of which travels everywhere with him.
              Many artists these days use a smartphone or perhaps a digital
              camera to make a record of some of the things that have caught
              their eye and which could be incorporated in a future work. Feijoo
              prefers to use a sketchbook, a time-honoured process-rich means of
              making connections. To have the privilege of seeing an artist's
              sketchbooks within the context of an exhibition adds considerably
              to the enjoyment of the work – it makes the connections visible.
              Drawing has become under-rated in our tech-rich lives, but is
              still a potent medium. This is evident in his sketchbooks, but
              also in to richness of line in his prints, and in his other works.
              They are compositionally complex, creating visions of an 'other'
              world through which the viewer's eyes can wander, seeking out the
              secrets or guessing at what is going on.
            </p>
            <p>
              To pay due respect to Feijoo's work requires a sense of engagement
              and complicity from the viewer, and the time spent is
              well-rewarded. Many of his works are in stark black and white,
              sometimes combining with great skill within the same image, areas
              that appear to be in negative and others in positive, adding a
              richness to the whole piece. His use of colour, when it happens,
              is closer to comic book than limpid watercolour, and all the more
              appropriate for that. In all of his works there are layers of
              visual mastery, trickery even, that make the act of looking at
              them both an adventure and an excitement, with an aftermath of
              thought-provoking satisfaction.
