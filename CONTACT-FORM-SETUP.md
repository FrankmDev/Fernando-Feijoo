# Contact Form Setup Guide

## ✅ Current Status: WORKING!

The contact form is **100% functional** and ready to use. It currently works in **development mode** where all submissions are logged to the server console.

## 🎯 What's Working Now

- ✅ **Form validation** (client and server-side)
- ✅ **Success/error messages** with proper styling
- ✅ **Loading states** (disabled form during submission)
- ✅ **Minimalist design** matching your website
- ✅ **Console logging** of all form submissions
- ✅ **API endpoint** at `/api/contact`

## 📧 Next Steps: Enable Real Email Sending

Choose one of these options to start receiving actual emails:

### Option 1: EmailJS (RECOMMENDED - Easiest Setup)

**Why EmailJS?**

- No server configuration needed
- Works from frontend only
- Free tier available
- Very reliable

**Setup Steps:**

1. Create account at [EmailJS.com](https://emailjs.com/)
2. Add email service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. Create email template
4. Get your credentials and add to `.env`:

```bash
EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
```

### Option 2: SMTP (Advanced Users)

For Gmail SMTP:

1. Enable 2-factor authentication
2. Generate app password
3. Add to `.env`:

```bash
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
```

## 🧪 Testing the Form

1. **Start the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. **Go to:** `http://localhost:4321/contact`

3. **Fill out the form** and submit

4. **Check the terminal** - you should see:

```
